# tiny-ray-caster

A tiny ray caster using raw SDL2, written in F#

This is an F# version of the excellent tutorial [here](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraycaster) by [Dmitry V. Sokolov](https://github.com/ssloy).

Why? Because I wanted to have a go using raw SDL2 from F# (not even using the SDL2-CS bindings from [flibitijibibo](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS)).

Also, given that Dmitry's work is just 486 lines of C++, I was interested to see how a language almost on the other end of the high/low spectrum from C++ would do :)
